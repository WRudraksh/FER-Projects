# Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) Project

This project focuses on detecting and classifying emotions from facial expressions using deep learning techniques. The goal is to accurately recognize emotions from grayscale facial images.

## Project Overview

The FER model is trained to predict various emotions (such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc.) based on facial features. The project uses state-of-the-art techniques in computer vision and deep learning to achieve high accuracy in emotion detection.

### Key Features:
- **Grayscale Image Processing**: Utilizes grayscale images for efficient emotion detection.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Implements neural networks to learn and predict emotions based on facial expressions.
- **Performance Metrics**: Includes evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to assess the model's performance.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
